# Virtual_Doctor_Using_Machine_Learning-Web-App-
Here is the virtual doctor which gives you medication according to disease
What is it?
It is a system designed to simulate a doctor's diagnostic and advisory capabilities through the use of artificial intelligence algorithms.

In this project, the virtual doctor would likely utilize a combination of natural language processing (NLP), machine learning, and possibly deep learning techniques. It would be trained on vast amounts of medical data, including symptoms, diagnoses, treatments, and outcomes.

The system would interact with users through a user interface, such as a chatbot or a web application. Users would input their symptoms or medical concerns, and the virtual doctor would analyze this information to provide relevant advice, potential diagnoses, and suggested courses of action. It may also offer general medical information and guidelines.

Steps to build ML Model:
1.Preprocess the dataset.
2.Split the dataset.
3.Train the dataset with the suitable model.
4.Check the accuracy using matrices.
5.Create a final model.
6.Test the model using testing data.


Steps to run the file:
1.Run Main.py
2.Fill the problems faced.
3.Get the output.
